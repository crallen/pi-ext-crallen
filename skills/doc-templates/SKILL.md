## Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Title of Decision

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Authors**: Name(s)

## Context

What is the problem or situation that requires a decision?
What constraints exist? What forces are at play?

## Decision

What is the decision that was made?
State it clearly and directly.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Name
- **Pros**: ...
- **Cons**: ...
- **Why rejected**: ...

### Alternative B: Name
- **Pros**: ...
- **Cons**: ...
- **Why rejected**: ...

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier or better?

### Negative
- What becomes harder or worse?
- What new constraints does this introduce?

### Risks
- What could go wrong?
- How can those risks be mitigated?
```

## Code Comment Guidelines

### When to Comment

- **WHY, not WHAT**: The code shows what happens. Comments explain why.
- **Non-obvious behavior**: Workarounds, business rules, performance tricks.
- **Important context**: Links to specs, issue numbers, external docs.
- **Public API**: Document parameters, return values, error conditions, and usage examples.

### When NOT to Comment

- Don't restate the code: `i++ // increment i` adds nothing.
- Don't leave commented-out code. Delete it; git has the history.
- Don't use comments as section dividers where functions would be better.
- Don't write TODOs without an associated issue or ticket number.

### Format

```
// Good: Explains WHY
// Rate limit is 100 req/min per the API docs (https://example.com/limits).
// We use 80 to leave headroom for retries.
const maxRequestsPerMinute = 80

// Bad: Restates WHAT
// Set max requests to 80
const maxRequestsPerMinute = 80
```
